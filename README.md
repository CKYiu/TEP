# Learning Generative Vision Transformer with Energy-Based Latent Space for Saliency Prediction (NeurIPS 2021)

# Saliency Maps
We provide saliency maps for RGB image based salient object detection models and RGB-D image pair based salient object detection models with both CNN backbone and transformer backbone.

For RGB image based models, we provide results on six testing datasets: DUTS_Test, ECSSD, DUT, HKU-IS, PASCAL-S and SOD.

For RGB-D image pair based models, we provide results on six testing datasets: NJU2K, NLPR, LFSD, SIP, DES and STERE.
